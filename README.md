# Unit-4-Game
Star Wars RPG Game using HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, Javascript, and JQuery

## Gameplay
The user can choose to play as four different characters: Obi-Wan Kenobi, Luke Skywalker, Darth Sidious, and Darth Maul. Each character is assigned a randomized HP value (displayed on their card), and hidden randomized values for counterattack and attack power. 

The user chooses their player by clicking on the character's card, and the three other characters will become enemies to attack. The user then can choose one of those three characters to attack first by clicking on their card. 

The user can attack that character by clicking on the "Attack" button. The opponent will lose HP corresponding to the player's attack value, and the player will lose HP corresponding to the opponent's counterattack value. The user can continue to attack the opponent until either the opponent or player runs out of HP. If the player runs out of HP, they have lost, the game is over, and they can reset and play a new game. If the opponent runs out of HP, the player can move on and choose another opponent to attack until they run out of opponents. If all opponents have been defeated, the user has won the game and has the choice to reset and play a new game.
